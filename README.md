Park Explorer is an application that allows you too see the most up-to-date images of the national parks that make our country great. Now you can see in real time, from pictures taken by your fellow explorers, how amazing our National Parks are. 

The motivation for creating this application was to provide an easy-to-use interface for people to discover where they want to visit. It is often difficult to truly explore these days with the over-saturation of information. On Park Explorer, there are o descriptions, no opinions, just photos. Photos to help you discover your adventure.
